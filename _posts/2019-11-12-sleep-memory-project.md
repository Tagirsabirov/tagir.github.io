In the 8th grade, I had decided to conduct a science fair study involving sleep and memory. I had always wondered how memory correlates with sleep, since parents always tell you to go to bed on time. I conducted this study by asking people how much they slept each night, and a test to see how well they remember content. For participation, I would give people candy. At the end of this study, I had near 70 data point, and had gotten 3rd place out of my grade for my science fair project. Here is the link:

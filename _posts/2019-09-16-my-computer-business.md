One day, I decided to start a computer building business on Fiverr to make money. After one week, I had my first customer. He wanted me to build him a computer and ship it to him. We decided that he would buy me the parts and get them delivered through Amazon, and after I would finish building the computer, I would ship him the finished PC. In the end, I shipped it to him through UPS. UPS damaged the side glass on the computer and threw away the entire computer because of its damage policy. I am still trying to getting a refund from UPS for their damages. After UPS had damaged the parcel, I did not ditch my customer. I maintained patience and kept asking him if he wanted any help. Even though I had an unlucky scenario with my first customer, other friends started wanting me to build them a PC after I had told them about my Fiverr business. I had already built my friend a PC after he found out about my PC building business.

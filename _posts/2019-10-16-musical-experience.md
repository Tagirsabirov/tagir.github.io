I have played 3 musical instruments, all three of which I enjoy practicing and playing. The piano, the ukulele, and the guitar. I am most experienced with the ukulele, then piano, then guitar.
I have played the ukulele since 2017, and have practiced it most compared to other instruments.
It is the only musical instrument my class learns at school, so I have had most time for it because it counts as a homework assignment.
I learned the piano when I was little because my grandma was a piano teacher, and when I visit her over the summer, I ask her to teach me.
I do not know how to play the piano very well, but I would like to learn since I have a piano at my house that my mom wanted one.
I try to teach myself how to play on the piano once a week. The guitar is new to me. My dad has a guitar and plays on it.
Since I play well on the Ukulele, I want to be good at guitar too. It is hard for me because it hurts to hold the strings, and because the neck is wider than that of the ukulele.

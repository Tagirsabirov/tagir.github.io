This December, my Dad is taking all the family to Japan for the first time. Because he is busy with work, he got me to do all the research
and trip planning and put it in a presentation that he and my mum could review.

After doing my research, I chose 5 cities that we could get too easily using a JR Rail pass. I had to be careful to not cram too much in as we will
also be taking my 3 year old sister, and she will get tired easily.

Here are the slides that I made with the trip itinery I recommended to my parents:

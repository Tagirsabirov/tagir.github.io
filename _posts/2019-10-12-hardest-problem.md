One of the most challenging problems Iâ€™ve had to overcome in my life was my transition between countries.
I was born in Russia and moved to London when I was 5 years old.
I had much trouble moving because I did not know the language well.
Before I moved, I studied a little bit of English to prepare, but it was only a small understanding of the most common or easy words and was not enough.
 When I moved, I did not understand most of what my teacher and classmates told me.
I struggled to communicate which is crucial in learning.
I remember the first day I went to school, I stared at my classmates without talking to them the whole day, thinking to myself about them the whole time.
The teacher was saying things at me which I could not understand and found confusing.
Imagine coming to your class, and staying mute all day long until you go home.
This would not be an easy challenge to most.
This problem was one of the hardest in my life because it took a long time to overcome.
The only way to overcome this problem was to learn English.
Learning a new language is a long, hard task to accomplish.
My English knowledge increased and became better only after years of studying it.
I started understanding after about 2 years of living in Great Britain and caught up in fluency after 4 years.
When I started understanding English, I started having more friends, and closer friends.

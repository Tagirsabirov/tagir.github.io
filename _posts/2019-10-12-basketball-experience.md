I love basketball. The only thing I don't like is that I started it in 6th grade and not earlier. 
Basketball is one of my favorite hobbies, and I play the sport almost everyday. 
I have started playing in the AAU league this year and enjoy playing and going to practice with my teammates. 
Even though I am not near the best on my team, I try my best, and try to be humble and open-minded to change.

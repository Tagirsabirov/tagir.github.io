I love basketball. It is my favorite sport and one of my favorite hobbies. The only problem I have with Basketball is that I started the sport

One activity in which I gained something by my involvement in it is the game of basketball. I gained persistence and teamwork by playing the game.

I started playing basketball in 6th grade. I hadn’t played it in 5th grade because it was my first year living in the United States. Before that, I had lived in the U.K. where basketball wasn’t as popular compared to soccer. As I started playing basketball, I was not very good. I still remember how I shot the ball with two hands while me and my classmates were playing knockout. I had only gained all the basic fundamentals by the end of 6th grade. I wanted to get better at basketball, so I kept trying and stayed persistent.

By 7th grade, I could dribble and shoot the ball with mediocracy, but I did not have much game sense. I wanted to play on a team. Unfortunately, as I wanted to do that, I fractured my arm trying to ride on a mechanical bull during Spring break. This not only stopped me from playing on an AAU team but also basketball for three months.

After Summer break, I finally started playing on an AAU team called YFE Elite. Playing on a team was different from streetball. There was more teamwork involved. On a team, the goal isn’t to show off how good you are at breaking someone’s ankles. It is to score more points than the other team, as a team. By playing on a team, I learned how to more efficiently pass the ball, screen, and coordinate with my teammates. Playing on a team taught me teamwork.

Throughout the season, I wasn't the best player on my team, I tried my best, and tried to be humble and open-minded to change. In the end, we did not lose any games until our best shooter had a surgery. After that, we lost two games, and scored 3rd in the season.

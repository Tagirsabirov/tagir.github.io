I love basketball. It is my favorite sport and one of my favorite hobbies. The only problem I have with Basketball is that I started the sport 
in 6th and not earlier. Basketball is one of my favorite hobbies, and I play the sport almost everyday.

I have started playing in the AAU league this year for the first time and enjoy playing and going to practice with my teammates.

Even though I am not near the best on my team, I try my best, and try to be humble and open-minded to change.
